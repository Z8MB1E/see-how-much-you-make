# See How Much You Make

A very rudimentary, super simple webpage that asks for your hourly wage, when you started working that day, and how many hours of break you've taken (for lunch, etc.). The page then uses that information to calculate how much money you've made since starting that day, updating every 50 milliseconds (though it may appear to be longer.)
